Zoom and Follow
---------------
Have you ever needed to zoom in on your screen to show some fine detail work, or to make your large 4k/ultrawide monitor appear less daunting on stream? **Zoom and Follow** for OBS Studio does exactly that, zooms in on your mouse and follows it around. Configurable and low-impact, you can now do old school Camtasia zoom ***live***!

*Maintained for the [current release version of OBS](https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio/releases/latest)*

*Inspired by [caharkness](https://obsproject.com/forum/members/caharkness.153928/)'s [Magic Window](https://obsproject.com/forum/threads/magic-window.107614/)*
